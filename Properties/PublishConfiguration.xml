		# Asset Variation Changer
		This mod allows you to control behavior of asset variations using hotkeys

		## Features

		### Selectable Asset Variation
		Use the **arrow keys** (changeable) to cycle through the available variations of the selected asset. There is currently no UI for this feature, but it is planned for a future update.
		Please note that not all assets have variations, and you have to move the asset to see the changes.

		### Asset Variations stay after placing
		After placing an asset the variation will stay the same, so it is easier to place multiple assets of the same variation in a row.

		### Works in the Asset Editor!

		## Disclaimer
		This mod is currently in an experimental state and there might be bugs. Please report any issues you encounter.

		## Feature roadmap
		- Compatibility with Line Tool
		- Visual Asset Selection
		- Other UI

		## Known Issues
		- Surfaces on some assets are still random

		## Acknowledgment
		I would like to thank
		* **Yenyang** for the Proof of Concept and initial project functionality.
		* **CityRat** for the Thumbnail
